Setting python 2.6 as default on Linux

If you have a later version than 2.6 you'll need to set 2.6 as the default Python. Later versions would be 2.7 and 3.1; see what you have by typing

python -V
at the terminal. For purposes of this example we'll assume you have 3.1 installed. You'll next need to execute the following commands:
sudo apt-get install python2.7 idle-python2.7
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 1
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 10
sudo update-alternatives --config python
This last command will allow you to choose which version of python to use by default. If you have done everything above correctly, python2.6 should already be set as the default. If it is not, choose it to be the default. From now on, running python should start version 2.6.

Undoing These Changes

In some cases (e.g., installing or updating certain packages), you'll get an error message if you've run the commands above. To update these packages, you'll have to temporarily undo these changes. Here's how to do that:

sudo update-alternatives --remove-all python
sudo ln -s python3.1 /usr/bin/python
Once you're done updating these packages, execute the commands at the top to set python2.6 as the default again.

***
Hey, @Ismaiel welcome to the forum. As can be seen in this issue this error is probably caused because the ~/.ignition/fuel/config.yaml file still points to the old ignition fuel domain. This error can be solved by replacing url: https://api.ignitionfuel.org by url: https://api.ignitionrobotics.org inside the ~/.ignition/fuel/config.yaml file.

WARNING: Failed to import lxml module etree. Are lxml, libxml2 and libxslt installed? XML validation will not be performed

*** For using the offboard mavros control with the last version:


    Use comment of benjinne.
    Run simulation and run QGroundControl. In Vehicle setup->Parameters set COM_RCL_EXCEPT=4.

    Use an older version of autopilot.
    Personally, I am using the latest stable version of autopilot at the moment (available by tag v1.12.3). Can be downloaded using this command:
    git clone --recurse-submodules --branch v1.12.3 https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git

***GAZEBO+ROS

no_sim=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
make px4_sitl gazebo_typhoon_h480

Modify iris.world in px4-firmware/Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds:
    <include>
      <uri>model://iris_fpv_cam</uri>
source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch world_name:=$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds/iris.world

****** IMPORTANT - FOR INSTALLING ARUCO MARKERS:
Install them on the PX4/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models


make px4_sitl gazebo_typhoon_h480
https://github.com/naveenbiitk/gazebo_simulation

** IMPORTANT: run source devel/setup.bash before or after catkin_make then rebuild
** image resolution is changed within the .sdf model of the drone
